                <p>
                    That's a pretty complicated question which deserves more than a brief response. Nonetheless, here's a condensed view of computer science at Stonehill.<br> Computer science courses fall roughly into four (overlapping) categories : theory, architecture, systems software, and applications.
                    <br> &nbsp;In one particular <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/THEORY.HTM">theory</a> course (<i> Theory of Computation </i>) you may discuss the limits of computation (&quot;What problems <b>cannot</b> be solved on a computer?&quot;) while in the <i>Algorithms </i>course you may write a program to find the shortest route between, say, New York and Los Angeles and then <em>prove </em>that you your solution is correct. In the <i>Compiler Design </i>course you will even learn how to design and implement your own homemade programming language.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> In the <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/ARCH.HTM">architecture</a> sequence you will explore the computer &quot;under the hood.&quot; In <i>Computer Logic and Organization</i>, you will design a small computer on paper and, later, in <i>Microcomputer Electronics</i> build your computer in the lab where you will see your logic come to life.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> The <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/SYS.HTM">systems software</a> group includes courses like <i>Operating Systems </i>where you'll learn how an operating system like Windows or UNIX&nbsp; is constructed. Rounding out the curriculum is a number of <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/APP.HTM">applications</a> courses like <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> where you will understand how a computer can play chess and even write a few games of your own or <i>Data Structures</i> where you may design a computer simulation to determine how many runways should be built for a community airport.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br> Of course, you will first learn how to write <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/PROG.HTM">computer programs</a>. To this end, all freshmen currently learn the programming language Java in their first year at Stonehill. In addition to formal courses, most students do internship work in their junior or senior years.<br>
                    <br> The professional organization of computer scientists, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.acm.org/">The ACM </a>can give you more detailed information about computer science and the many career opportunities fo computer scientists.

                    Stonehill College has partnered with CampusHP to create this program so that Stonehill College students can have a HP laptop that offers a standardized computing environment at very reasonable academic discount pricing.

                    Qualified upper classmen often do <a target = "_blank" href="https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/Internships.htm">internships</a> for credit. In fact, in recent years most students have done internship work. Typically, a student will work 10-12 hours per week on his/her internship and earn three semester hours of course credit.&nbsp; Many of our students do internships at local companies such as General Dynamics, which is an easy&nbsp; commute to Stonehill.&nbsp;
